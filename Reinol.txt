 working on creating 3 classes 
 1) die class that can be calld from any game to roll a die that has 3-100 sides
 2) craps class that creates a craps game that uses the die class to roll the dice
 3) analyzer class that takes in data from the craps class to see how many iterations of games and other statistics
